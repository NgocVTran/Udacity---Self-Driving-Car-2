## Reflection (update after reviewed)

* Q: Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation. Is it what you expected? Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.

* A: PID is short of Proportional - Integral - Derivative controller.
  * P-value means that car will steer in proportion to the current track error. If the car is to the left of the line then you would steer it to the right. P-value produces an output that is proportional to the current error. The larger this term, the larger the output, given a change in the error. If it is too small, the controller would not be too responsive.
  * I-value is the integral control, it considers all past values of the CTE and itâ€™s measured by the integral or the sum of the crosstrack errors over time. This will encourage the car to turn back toward the reference path. If it is set too high, the car tends to have quick oscillations, otherside this coefficient is set too low, the car may stay in one side of the reference path for long periods of time.
  * D-value is the change in CTE from current value to the next one. It helps the car more stable in term of curve. Too high D-value will make the car steer in large angle. 
  * Video: although the car still have oscillation, but it still can run pass the round: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK_9k4N1WzI

* Q: Student discusses how they chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). This could be have been done through manual tuning, twiddle, SGD, or something else, or a combination!
* A: I have tunned the PID manually by setting  I-value and D-value to zeroes, and P-value was adjusted so that the vehicle would oscillate around the center of the road without crashing. Increase the Integral and decrease P-value. Then increase D-value to make system response faster.

    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
